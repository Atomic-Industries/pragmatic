\pragmatic is an open source\footnote{GNU Lesser General Public
  License} framework that provides 2D/3D anisotropic mesh adaptivity
for meshes of simplexes. The target applications are finite element
and finite volume methods although the it can also be used as a lossy
compression algorithm for 2 and 3D data (\eg\ image compression). It
takes as its input the mesh and a metric tensor field which encodes
desired mesh element size anisotropically. The toolkit is written in
C++ and has OpenMP and MPI parallel support.
