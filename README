DESCRIPTION:
PRAgMaTIc (Parallel anisotRopic Adaptive Mesh ToolkIt) provides 2D/3D
anisotropic mesh adaptivity for meshes of simplexes. The target
applications are finite element and finite volume methods although the
it can also be used as a lossy compression algorithm for 2 and 3D data
(e.g. image compression). It takes as its input the mesh and a metric
tensor field which encodes desired mesh element size
anisotropically. The toolkit is written in C++ and has OpenMP and MPI
parallel support.

BUILD:
$ ./configure
$ make

TESTING:
$ make test

INSTALL:
If you want to install to a specific location then specify the
argument --prefix=/target_location for ./configure. The default
location is /usr/local.

$ make install

RPM:
A RPM spec file is provided in the source root directory. Typically
you need to create a tar ball of the source directory and then execute
rpmbuild, e.g.:

$ rpmbuild -ta pragmatic-0.1.tar.gz 

See rpmbuild documentation for more details.

DEBIAN:

A Debian package is provided. To build a deb simply cd to the source
directory and execute:

$ dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc
